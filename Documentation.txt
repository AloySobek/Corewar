For this shit code doesn't exist any documentation, will be better if you do not read this shit code :(

/* Visualizator for VM */

Basically, you only need to know about two functions:
	-> int cr_vis_main (corewar_t *cr, int act);
			where 'cr' is a main game object and 'act' is the needed action
			there are five actions in total:
				V_INIT,								// initialise the map (use once at the begining)
				V_CONTROL,							// update time(for framerate) and check key input (use as often as you can)
				V_UPDATE,							// draw current map/info in terminal (use every time you want to display changed data)
				V_CLEANUP							// clean allocated memory and get rid of the visuals (use once at the end)
	-> void cr_vis_putx (int num, int i, int colour, int rev, corewar_t *cr);
			where 'num' is a value of a char
			'i' is a position on the map(index in an array)
			'colour' is a desired drawing colour (use id of a player)
			'rev' determines whether a carriage(1) or  a simple map tile(0) will be drawn
			'cr' is a main game object
