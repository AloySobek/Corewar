execution model is:
	we have three containers:
		1)Distribution stack (in this stack fall into all carriage first)
			* after all carraige is init they fall into this stack
			* it task is to distribute those carriage
			* for solve this task it need to go through all carriage in it
			* on each carriage it need to set coommand to carraige and if success to set waiting_time too
			* in another case, if not success - that carriage rotate to dawn of stack
			* after set time and command carriage pushing to waiting_queue
			* that's all ^^^
		2)Waiting queue
			* this queue to through all carriage
			* every time this happens waiting_time of carriage reduce at constant that is in Distribution stack
			* if waiting_time is zero then this carriage go to the next step - execution_queue
